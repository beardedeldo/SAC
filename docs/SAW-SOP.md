# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Semi Automatic Weapon (SAW) Training for Shadow Division 

## Overview

> **Trainers:** Ensure comprehension before advancing. Share SOPs with participants for pre-training study.

### Game Master

> Set up the following stations near the main base with adequate spacing for transitioning between locations.

1. Shooting Range.
2. Sandbag covers with down-range targets.
3. Sandbags for buddy bounding. 
4. Set up scenario: CQC and ambush. 

# SAW Training 1: SAW Familiarization and Handling

## Objective 1.0

Familiarize participants with the SAW and its handling.

> **Trainers:** Provide a detailed overview of the SAW's components, safety procedures, and handling techniques.

## SAW Handling Procedures

### 1. Safety Procedures

- **Clearing:** Always ensure the SAW is clear before handling.
- **Trigger Discipline:** Keep finger off the trigger until ready to fire.
- **Muzzle Awareness:** Always point the muzzle in a safe direction.

### 2. Operating the SAW

- **Loading and Unloading:** Demonstrate proper loading and unloading procedures.
- **Clearing Jams:** Teach participants how to clear common jams quickly and safely (to be added via mod later). 
- **Keeping an eye on ammo:** Teach particpants to call out when alsmost "empty", and "need cover, reloading".

### 3. Firing Techniques

- **Burst Fire:** Emphasize controlled bursts for accuracy and ammunition conservation.
- **Sustained Fire:** Teach participants how to maintain sustained fire while minimizing overheating.

> **Trainers:** Allow participants to practice handling the SAW under supervision at the shooting range.

# SAW Training 2: Marksmanship and Target Engagement

> **Trainers:** Conduct exercises at the shooting range.

## Objective 2.0

Improve participants' marksmanship and proficiency in engaging targets with the SAW.

### 1. SAW Marksmanship Fundamentals

- **Sight Alignment and Picture:** Teach participants how to properly align sights and acquire targets.
- **Breath Control:** Emphasize the importance of steady breathing for accuracy and shooting in bursts. 
- **Trigger Control:** Instruct on smooth trigger pulls to maintain accuracy. Note how muzzle moves up when continuous holding of trigger. 
- **Weak points:** Demonstrate shooting at weak points (on VICS = engine, tires, windows). 

### 2. Engaging Single and Multiple Targets

- **Single Target Engagement:** Practice engaging stationary targets with controlled bursts.
- **Multiple Target Engagement:** Introduce techniques for transitioning between multiple targets efficiently, including moving VICs. 

> **Trainers:** Assess participants' marksmanship skills and provide feedback for improvement.

# SAW Training 3: Fire and Maneuver Tactics

> **Trainers:** Conduct exercises at the designated bunkers location.

## Objective 3.0

Teach participants fire and maneuver tactics utilizing the SAW within a squad context.

### 1. Suppressive Fire

- **Role of the SAW:** Explain the SAW's role in providing suppressive fire to support squad movement.
- **Sector of Fire:** Instruct participants on establishing and maintaining effective sectors of fire.

### 2. Bound and Cover Techniques

- **Bounding Overwatch:** Teach participants how to alternate between bounding and providing covering fire -- also known as "Talking Guns". 
- **Covering Fire:** Emphasize the importance of providing effective covering fire while squad members move.

> **Trainers:** Conduct live fire exercises to practice fire and maneuver tactics, grading participants based on their performance.

# SAW Training 4 (Final Exam): Tactical Scenario Simulations

## Objective 4.0

Evaluate participants' ability to apply SAW training in realistic MILSIM scenarios.

### Scenario-based Exercises

- **Urban Operations:** Simulate urban combat scenarios requiring effective use of the SAW in close quarters.
- **Ambush Response:** Test participants' ability to react to enemy ambushes while employing SAW tactics.
- **Defense and Counterattack:** Evaluate participants' proficiency in defending positions and launching counterattacks using the SAW.

> **Trainers:** This phase assesses participants' ability to apply SAW tactics and techniques in dynamic MILSIM scenarios. Provide feedback and debrief after each exercise.
